## Coffeemasters app
This is a code-along project from "Vanilla JS: You Might Not Need a Framework" course from https://frontendmasters.com

Project serves mainly as learning sandbox for implementing web dev techniques using native JavaScript, not a traditional library/framework like React, Angular, Svelte or others.

Web dev techniques implemented in this project:
- SPA router
- Templating
- Two way data binding
- Resources prefetching (for performance)
- Web Components
- Shadow DOM
- API

The project code is quite tightly coupled, implementation dependant. It requires some refactor work, adding additional abstractions using design patterns.

### Plans for the future, improvements to do :
- Refactor code to make some reusable utilities, components, helpers (for example router, templating (usin more advanced templating techniques like "lit-html" - https://lit.dev/docs/v1/lit-html/introduction/)

### To start the app:
``npx serve``
